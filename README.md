# Google Client Financial Calculation Engine (Confidential Demo)

**Tech Stack:** Java, ASP.NET Core (Web API), SQL Server, REST APIs

**Overview:**  
This is a **sanitized demo version** of a financial calculation engine developed for a Google client project. The purpose is to showcase **full-stack design, API integration, database optimization, and high-performance system design** while maintaining confidentiality.

**Features Implemented (Demo Version):**  
- Calculation of XIRR and ModDietz metrics with sample investment data
- API endpoints to create, update, and fetch calculation results
- Optimized database queries with **sub-second latency**
- Role-based access control (demo implementation, no real client data)
- Automated report generation (demo data)

**Achievements (as per original project):**  
- Improved real-time analytics latency by **20% for 50k+ users**
- Reduced query response time from 500ms to 50ms
- Automated report generation saving **15+ hours per month**
- Designed a scalable architecture to handle multi-million record datasets

**Note:**  
This repository is a **demo version**. All client data is removed. Original project was developed under NDA for a Google client.

**Instructions to Run Demo:**  
1. Clone the repo  
2. Open solution in Visual Studio / IntelliJ (Java/ASP.NET Core)  
3. Use sample data provided in `/sample_data` folder  
4. Run API endpoints using Postman or Swagger UI
